Problem statement:
     Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Approach to solve the problem:
Suppose we have a stack of three disks. Our job is to move this stack from source A to destination C. How do we do this?
Before we can get there, let’s imagine there is an intermediate point B.

We can use B as a helper to finish this job. We are now ready to move on. Let’s go through each of the steps:
Move the first disk from A to C
Move the first disk from A to B
Move the first disk from C to B
Move the first disk from A to C
Move the first disk from B to A
Move the first disk from B to C
Move the first disk from A to C
Code for tower of Hanoi:
    #include <stdio.h> 
void towerOfHanoi(int n, char from_rod, char to_rod, char aux_rod) 
{ 
        if (n == 1) 
        { 
            printf("\n Move disk 1 from rod %c to rod %c", from_rod, to_rod); 
            return; 
        } 
        towerOfHanoi(n-1, from_rod, aux_rod, to_rod); 
        printf("\n Move disk %d from rod %c to rod %c", n, from_rod, to_rod); 
        towerOfHanoi(n-1, aux_rod, to_rod, from_rod); 
      } 
     int main() 
    { 
        int n = 4; // Number of disks 
      towerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B');  // A, B and C are names of rods 
 return 0; 
     } 

OutPut :
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
 Move disk 2 from rod A to rod C
 Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
 Move disk 3 from rod A to rod B
 Move disk 1 from rod C to rod A
 Move disk 2 from rod C to rod B
 Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
 Move disk 4 from rod A to rod C
 Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
 Move disk 2 from rod B to rod A
 Move disk 1 from rod C to rod A
 Move disk 3 from rod B to rod C
 Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
 Move disk 2 from rod A to rod C
 Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
